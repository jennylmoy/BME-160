# BME 160: Research Programming in the Life Sciences

### Overview:
This repository contains two programming laboratory assignments from my BME 160: Research Programming in the Life Sciences course at UC Santa Cruz. These projects focus on the intersection of biology and computer programming utilizing the Python language to achieve this. Both labs analyzed genomic data and automated processes such as locating open reading frames in DNA sequences and finding unique substrings in mitochondrial tRNA genes. 

### Files:
#### Lab 5:
`findORFs.py` 

`sequenceAnalysis.py`

#### Lab 6:
`findUnique.py`

### Requirements:
These projects utilize Python 3.x, and no external libraries were imported and used into my programs. 

### Acknowledgements:
These laboratory projects were completed as a part of the BME 160: Research Programming in the Life Sciences curriculum at UC Santa Cruz.
