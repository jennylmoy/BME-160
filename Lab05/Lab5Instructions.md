# Lab 5: ORF Finder and Sequence Analysis Background and Guide

### Background:
Every organism has a genome that contains their entire body of DNA, becoming the blueprint for the organism. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a  long strand made up of the nucleotide bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). These strands contain a region called the open reading frame (ORF) that is able to be translated into an amino acid protein sequence. ORFs are certain sequences of DNA usually with a 5’ start codon and 3’ stop codon. 

Additionally, there are design choices and special cases of locating ORFs that will be explained below. 

For this project, I have utilized ‘ATG’ for the start codon and ‘TAG’, ‘TAA’, and ‘TGA’ for the stop codons. 

I have provided an example of my code should work below:
